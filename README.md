![Java Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17+-blue.svg) ![API Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-Spigot%201.21-orange.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

A comprehensive Spigot plugin designed to manage and enhance an "All Advancements" challenge between players. It provides a dynamic user interface, full administrative control, and a robust tracking system to make the experience as seamless as possible.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üèÜ Progress Tracking:** A dynamic Boss Bar displays global progress and a running timer.
* **üíæ Persistent Storage:** All progress, the timer, and the current challenge state are automatically saved, surviving server restarts and crashes.
* **üåê Multi-Language Support:** Full support for German, English, and Polish. The language can be changed live in-game or via the configuration file.
* **üñ•Ô∏è Graphical User Interface (GUI):** An interactive, paginated menu (`/agui`) to view all advancements. Completed achievements are highlighted and show details like the player and timestamps.
* **üëë Full Admin Control:** A complete set of commands to manage the challenge lifecycle:
    * **Start:** Begins the challenge and disables vanilla advancement announcements for a cleaner chat.
    * **Pause/Resume:** Completely freezes the game (timer, players, mobs) and seamlessly resumes it.
    * **Stop:** Gracefully ends the challenge while keeping all data for review.
    * **Reset:** A powerful reset command for all player and plugin data, complete with a confirmation step.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Fully Configurable:** Customize the Boss Bar color, messages, and technical settings via a simple `config.yml`.
* **üé® Polished Notifications:** All important events are communicated through beautifully formatted, clear messages in chat.
